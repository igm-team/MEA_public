In order to analyze data please download the MEA Analysis package (IGM.MEA_0.3.2.tar.gz). Within the package there is a README file that details the steps for proper installation and how to analyze the data avaiable here. 

Each zip file uploaded here contains the spikelist files and the platemap files used for analysis in each experiment. An older version of the spikelist, called the maptimestamps file, has been uploaded in the case of experiment 1 due to the time in which data was generation. 
To use the package, upload the spikelist and the platemap file and hit run in the GUI.
